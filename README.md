# Hoya

Hoya is a service that provides remote code execution for JavaScript and WebAssembly files. It fetches code from a URL and executes it in a sandboxed environment, providing a few key APIs for both JavaScript and WebAssembly runtimes.

## Features

### FR1: Code Retrieval

- **FR1.3**: Auto-detection of code type from URL (.js or .wasm)
- **FR1.4**: Downloading code from remote URLs

### FR2: JavaScript Execution

- **FR2.1**: Execute JavaScript code in a QuickJS runtime
- **FR2.3**: API Injections:
  - `app_log(level, message)`: Log messages with a specified level
  - `get_unixtime()`: Get the current Unix timestamp
  - `fetch(options)`: Make HTTP requests (limited implementation)

### FR3: WebAssembly Execution

- **FR3.1**: Execute WebAssembly modules
- **FR3.3**: API Injections:
  - `app_log(level_ptr, level_len, msg_ptr, msg_len)`: Log messages with a specified level
  - `get_unixtime()`: Get the current Unix timestamp
  - `fetch(options_ptr, options_len, resp_buf_ptr, resp_buf_max_len)`: Make HTTP requests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hoya.git
cd hoya

# Build the project
cargo build
```

### Running the Server

```bash
cargo run
```

This will start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Usage

Hoya exposes a single endpoint `/execute` which takes a JSON payload with a `url` field pointing to a JavaScript or WebAssembly file.

### Example: Execute JavaScript

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/your-script.js"}'
```

### Example: Execute WebAssembly

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/your-module.wasm"}'
```

## Testing the Features

The repository includes example files and a test script to help you verify the functionality.

### Quick Test

You can use the included test script to quickly test the JavaScript functionality:

```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x test_hoya.sh

# Run the test script
./test_hoya.sh
```

This script:

1. Starts the Hoya server in the background
2. Starts a simple HTTP server to serve the example JavaScript file
3. Sends a request to execute the JavaScript file
4. Displays the response
5. Cleans up by stopping both servers

### Testing JavaScript Execution Manually

1. Use the included example JavaScript file in `examples/test.js`:

```javascript
// examples/test.js
app_log("INFO", "Testing app_log API");
app_log("ERROR", "This is an error message");
app_log("DEBUG", "This is a debug message");

// Test get_unixtime API
const timestamp = get_unixtime();
app_log("INFO", `Current Unix timestamp: ${timestamp}`);

// Test console.log (should be captured by app_log internally)
console.log("This is a console.log message");

// Try to use fetch API
try {
  fetch({ url: "https://example.com" });
} catch (error) {
  app_log("ERROR", `Fetch failed as expected: ${error.message}`);
}

// Return a value (will be sent back in the response)
("JavaScript execution completed successfully. ðŸŽ‰");
```

2. Start a server to host the file (e.g., using Python's http.server):

```bash
cd examples
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

3. In another terminal, send a request to execute it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "http://localhost:8000/test.js"}'
```

### Testing WebAssembly Execution

The repository includes a WebAssembly example project in `examples/wasm-test/`:

1. Build the WebAssembly test module:

```bash
cd examples/wasm-test
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown  # If you don't have the wasm target installed
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

2. Start a server to host the compiled .wasm file:

```bash
cd target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release
python3 -m http.server 8001
```

3. In another terminal, send a request to execute it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "http://localhost:8001/hoya_wasm_test.wasm"}'
```

You should receive a response indicating that the WebAssembly module was executed and see the log messages in the server output.
